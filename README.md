## Hey guys! The main goal of making this app was to learn more about Swift Optionals, solidify the understanding of the MVC design pattern and to introduce the concept of Classes. The topics were:
* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and difference between classes and structs. 
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference. 
* Formatting Strings. 
* Color literals.

## This is a project from the iOS development bootcamp, taught by Angela Yu :)
